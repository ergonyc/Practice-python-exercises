# OSCON 2015 Jonathan Whitmore
## IPython (Jupyter) Notebook for Data Science 

I gave a [talk](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/42315) on Friday (July 24) at the 2015 [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/grid/public) in Portland, OR. My topic was on the IPython (Jupyter) Notebook for Data Science, and it highlighted a number of challenges that come from needing to organize a data science workflow -- especially in the context of working on a team of data scientists. This repo contains the code from that talk.
