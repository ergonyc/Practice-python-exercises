    "Overview \n",
    "The trade dataset is the result of the effort to code trade flows between states (as defined by the Correlates of War project) for the period 1870-2014. The data include information on both bilateral trade flows and total national imports and exports. The dyadic trade dataset describes import and export data in current U.S. dollars for pairs of sovereign states. The National (Monadic) Trade dataset contains information on individual states import and export levels in current U.S. dollars. \n",
